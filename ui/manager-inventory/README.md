Getting started with Inventory Manager App

1 - You will run an nmp install for both the api extention in the terminal and the ui/manager-inventory extention.

an example would look like the following:  ~/projects/inventoryM/InventoryManager/api$  or ~/projects/inventoryM/InventoryManager/ui/manager-inventory$ 

2- The localhost:3000/ extention will not work for testing functionality. You will need to go to /Dashboard or /login or /Resgister 

3- You will get an error once you try to add and remove items from the inventory because I changed the api extention while testing a few things.

4- before testing member functions you must first Register to be able to log in. The seed data was not salted or hashed, but once an account is created it is.
   from there you can login and log out like normal.

5- the buttons will work in the back end when trying to add an item, but in order for this to work without the red error popping up, 
   you will need to remove the api portion in the api call for the post. You will find it on line 59 in the app.js file in the api folder.

6- The delete function also appears to go through but it does not fully function properly. 
   To not see the additional errors, you need to edit the api call for the delete as well. You will find it on line 101 in the app.js file in the api folder.

7- This is as far as I was able to get during troubleshooting to display the inventory onto the page. If you have any questions please contact me!

































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
